This is different to other converters because it:

* Actually outputs polygons as polygons (it doesn't pre-hatch or convert to a bitmap), keeping the board file from getting huge
* It handles polygons with holes
* Copes with both filled and unfilled paths
* Doesn't need installing - just upload an SVG, and copy/paste the script
